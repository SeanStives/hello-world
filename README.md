# hello-world
## I am figuring all this out and learning at least one new thing each day.


My name is Sean Stives, and I am making a transition into the world of programming and software development.

In my current life I am a strength and conditioning coach and massage therapist.

While on the surface level it appears to be a big switch in careers, I am finding more and more similarities between the two domains.

> Both are all about applying general concepts and learning specific protocols to better apply those concepts to new and old problems, taking a systemic approach to each, breaking them down into simpler elements, and creating solutions which not only solve the problems, but build the toolbox for the professional so that they are better equipped to respond to the next problem they face. 

It is still a lot to take in, though. 

I am frequently reminded of the phrase "like taking a sip from a fire hose". 

But the information is not going anywhere. 

There are no bad days. Either: 
- You win and get to high five your buddies, blasting "We are the Champions" at max volume

**OR**

- You learn something that will prepare you for a win later. A lot of times it is learning that you did not know you did not know something. Those are the best days. It means you can still grow and get better. 

Right now we are experiencing a lot of the latter. 

But that's good. 

It means I am about to get exponentially further down the path than I was yesterday. 

### The Goal of this project is to help document my education and hold myself accountable to try and learn one new thing every single day.
